### Sequence to Sequence models for Dialogue Learning
* Notebook is more for intuition than performance. 
* Main training file is parallel_training.py. You can change encoders and decoder by editing the appropriate files
* Models are autosaved every 20 iterations of the whole corpus and are created in the main directory of the repository with names __encoder__ and __decoder__.
* If you wish to continue training from the checkpoints parallel_py has a recover flag in its main function

## Programms were tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3 and PyTroch 1.0.1.post2
